- NFTs in the app are QR codes that are readable by regular scanners

- during the registration process, every voter gets an NFT1 with the voting information
- on election day the voter goes to the polls and show the NFT1 to the official
- if the voter loses the NFT1, the official can generate one if the voter is confirmed registered
- the official reads the NFT1 confirming all the data and that the voter hasn't voted yet
- the official authorizes the voter to vote in the app
- the voter receives authorization to vote from the app

- the app shows all the information about the election and the voter makes the choice
- the app takes the selection from the pool and asks for confirmation of the vote
- the app generates an NFT2 with the information of the selections voted
- the voter presents the NFT2 to the official
- the official reads it and the app confirms the vote received
- the app register in the NFT2 the confirmation that the vote has been cast
- the NFT1 is marked voted so the voter can't vote again
- the app can't generate another NFT1 after that

- the NFT1 contains the information about the election but not about the voter 
- it works as an authorization ticket to vote

- the NFT2 contains the information about the vote but not the voter
- it works like a receipt
- it can be read only at official stations
- in those station it retrieves the vote casted in that NFT but no information about the voter

- the app works like a wallet where both NFTs will be stored 
- the NFTs can be downloaded and shared by anyone
- they are unique and correspond to one voting authorization and one casted vote

- anyone can present the NFT1 and the NFT2
- the app will show that NFT1 was registered and NFT2 was casted but they can't be linked to a voter
